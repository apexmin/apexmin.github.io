# About Me

Experienced software engineer, creating various mobile testing software at Samsung Electronics for almost 4 years. Developed Android and desktop applications, experienced in audio signal processing and data analysis, built CI/CD environments, and led a project in collaboration with multiple companies.

As an enthusiastic hacker and a lifelong student, I have a deep interest in the vast fields of artificial intelligence. Among them, I am most attracted to the viability of a common model which can be used in interdisciplinary fields such as computer vision and natural language. I am intrigued by multi-modal learning and its applications, such as question answering in different modalities.
